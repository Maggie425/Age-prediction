# ðŸ§  Age Prediction System

A Python-based project that predicts the age of a person using a facial image.  
Uses OpenCV's pre-trained deep learning model and Dlib for face detection.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
## ðŸ§¾ Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run :
python age_predictor.py


ðŸŽ¯ Age Groups Predicted
The model can classify faces into the following age ranges:

(0â€“2)

(4â€“6)

(8â€“12)

(15â€“20)

(25â€“32)

(38â€“43)

(48â€“53)

(60â€“100)

These are pre-defined by the OpenCV age classifier and are not continuous numerical predictions.
